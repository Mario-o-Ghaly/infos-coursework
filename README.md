# infos-coursework
This is an educational operating system called Infos, which I modified its scheduling algorithm to be a **Multiple Queue Process Schedule** and Physical memory allocation algorithm to be a **buddy allocation algorithm**.

This was implemented individually by the author as a part of my project in Operating Systems course at the University of Edinburgh during Spring 2023.

Everything needed for running and understanding the code is mentioned in the *InfOS_specification* pdf file.
